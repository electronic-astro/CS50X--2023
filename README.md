#### Description:

In today's world, online security is more important than ever, and one of the most critical steps we can take to protect ourselves is to use strong, unique passwords for each account we have. Unfortunately, it can be challenging to come up with secure passwords that we can remember, leading many people to reuse the same passwords across multiple accounts. This practice puts us at significant risk, as a single password compromise could lead to all of our accounts being hacked.

To help solve this problem, I built a password generator that allows users to generate a random password based on the length and complexity they specify. The generated password can include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring that it is difficult for anyone to guess. To maintain the highest level of security, passwords must be a minimum of eight characters in length.

My password generator project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in addition to utilizing the Chrome API to attach it to the Chrome browser for speedy access. One of the unique features of this password generator is the ability to customize the password length and complexity. The interface is user-friendly, and users can generate passwords with just a few clicks.

Additionally, the password generator includes a functionality that allows you to copy the generated password to your clipboard, saving time and making it easier to use.

I hope that this password generator can help you protect your online accounts and feel more secure online. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback about the password generator project.
